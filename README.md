# Arduino Communication Server
A simple and easy to use solution to deploy, manage and do OTA updates for any WiFi-enabled Arduino based chip. This framework allows developers to get started with ESP8266 devices for personal and professional use.

## Your DIY IoT solution for Arduino based wifi enabled microcontrollers
For any IoT enthusiasts who wants to set up any IoT device with sensors and monitor the data collected through it; this project can be your go to solution. With an intuitive and user-friendle user interface it makes things easy for user to set up, update, modify and monitor the various IoT modules deployed in the field with very little effort.

 This project can be used as a prototype and/or boiler plate code for developing a system to manage Arduino based wifi enabled micro-chips.

## Overview
The main goal of this project is to be able to deploy, configure and manage multiple Arduino based Wifi enabled chips with minimum effort and work. To accomplish this objective, the firmware on the device uses the open source library provided for its architecture along with some third party open source libraries. For now this project primarily supports ESP8266 based devices, but can be built upon and/or modified to support any Arduino devices as long as it can communicate with the server. For using this solution user is required to host the node.js based server on internet or local network and pass the correct server information in the code as we shall see in the sample code.
